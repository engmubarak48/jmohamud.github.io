### Bio

Up until 2024, I was a nomadic AI research engineer working at different institutions and companies, having traveled to over 20 countries, I have now settled in Montreal working at Mila Quebec AI institute. Before Mila, I was research Fellow at German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). Prior to DFKI, I was a Google DeepMind scholar working with the remarkable [Ulrich Paquet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ulrich-paquet-72b6055a/?originalSubdomain=uk) and Willie Brink on understanding why deep learning works, particularly studying why pretraining models are so effective. And before this, I was working on privacy preserving self-supervised representation learning with [Moustapha Cisse](https://nexteinstein.org/person/moustapha-cisse/). 

ðŸ’¡ I have also recently started PhD at the University of Montreal, supervised by [Mirco Ravanelli](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/mirco-ravanelli) and [Yoshua Bengio](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/yoshua-bengio). My research primarily revolves around the intersection of AI and neuroscience. I am interested to understand how the human brain functions by developing general-purpose models for the brain. I particularly work on deep representation learning, graph neural networks and language models and their applications to human brain, drug discovery, and healthcare. 

Additionally, I'm exploring foundational models, with a particular emphasis on fine-tuning large language models for downstream tasks like reasoning and code generation.

### Community work

Beyond my research, in my free time, I'm passionate about contributing to open-source projects and machine learning for societal good. Particularly, I would like to study the effects of weather like rising temperatures, floods, etc., on various geographical scales. If you have an exciting project or are seeking collaboration or have a geo-spatial problem, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always eager to learn and help. In the past, I have:

* Served as a TA for two consecutive years at [Neuromatch Academy](https://neuromatch.io/neuroscience/) for the [Deep learning Summer School](https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html) 
* Served as a TA at [African Institute for Mathemetical Science](https://nexteinstein.org/) to help next cohort AMMI students on foundational machine learning courses. 
* Contributed to several open-source projects, including:
  - [Gflownets Library](https://github.com/alexhernandezgarcia/gflownet) a machine learning framework for probabilistic and generative modelling
  - [Graphium Library](https://github.com/datamol-io/graphium) for scaling molecular GNNs to infinity
  - [Jraph](https://github.com/google-deepmind/jraph) - A library for graph neural networks in jax.
* Supported the Deep Learning Indaba (DLI), the largest AI conference in Africa, by contributing to the practicals for three consecutive years: 
  - [DLI Graph Neural Networks practical 2022](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2022/blob/main/practicals/GNN_practical.ipynb)
  - [DLI Recommender Systems practical 2023](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2023/blob/main/practicals/Recommender_Systems.ipynb)
  - [DLI GNNs for Recommender Systems practical 2024](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2024/tree/main/practicals/Recommender_Systems)
